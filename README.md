#What Should We Play

Every board gamer will tell you that, when a group of people get together for gaming, the most common question is, 

*(someone shouts from the back row)*

**"Anybody wanna order pizza?"**

Okay, yeah I'll grant you that. But another very common question is

*(someone else shouts from the back row)*

**These dice hate me!**

That's not even a question!

**Why do these dice hate me?**

Karmic vengeance, bcause you cheat at everything you play!

Any other troublemakers? All right, great. The most common question is,

**Where's the bathroom?**

Down the hall, first door on the left. 

*(Someone gets up, opens the door, walks down the hall, opens another door. A loud roar is heard, then a scream.)*

Oops. Silly me, the bathroom is on the right, the "Cranky Hungry Grizzly" room is on left. ***Anybody else?***

Right, great. As I was saying, the most common question is "What should we play today?" Let's hear some suggestions.

* Seven Wonders
* Arkham Horror
* Through the Ages
* Campaign for North Africa *(laughter)*
* Monopo... *(dead silence, followed by the heretic being dragged off to the grizzly room.)*

So, the very simple version is you can record each player's vote by clicking on that player's link, and selecting that player's vote. It's not a secret ballot; we're all friends here, right?

*Not me! I hate Bob!*

We all do; that's why we just fed him to the grizzly. 

Anyway, you'd evetnually click a 'tally the votes" button and see the winner!
