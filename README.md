#What Should We Play

## Picture a Panel at a Gaming Convention
Every board gamer will tell you that, when a group of people get together for gaming, the most common question is, 

*(someone shouts from the back row)*

**"Anybody wanna order pizza?"**

Okay, yeah I'll grant you that. But another very common question is

*(someone else shouts from the back row)*

**These dice hate me!**

That's not even a question!

**Why do these dice hate me?**

Karmic vengeance, bcause you cheat at everything you play!

Any other troublemakers? All right, great. The most common question is,

**Where's the bathroom?**

Down the hall, first door on the left. 

*(Someone gets up, opens the door, walks down the hall, opens another door. A loud roar is heard, then a scream.)*

Oops. Silly me, the bathroom is on the right, the "Cranky Hungry Grizzly" room is on left. ***Anybody else?***

Right, great. As I was saying, the most common question is "What should we play today?" Let's hear some suggestions.

* Seven Wonders
* Arkham Horror
* Through the Ages
* Campaign for North Africa *(laughter)*
* Monopo... *(dead silence, followed by the heretic being dragged off to the grizzly room.)*

So, the very simple version is you can record each player's vote by clicking on that player's link, and selecting that player's vote. It's not a secret ballot; we're all friends here, right?

*Not me! I hate Bob!*

We all do; that's why we just fed him to the grizzly. 

Anyway, you'd evetnually click a 'tally the votes" button and see the winner! 

*(Thunderous applause. I am immediately nominated for a Golden Geek Award, a Spiel de Jahres, the Games 100, and, oddly enough, a Tony. I lose all of them to Hamilton.)*



## Possible Enhancements

*(Note: This will include several references to the site [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/), aka "BGG" or "The Geek". It's a huge database of games and players. It is to board games what imdb is to movies.)*

That bit of silliness aside, there are numerous enhancements I can see. These are basically in the order I'd like to implement them. 

### Hopefully for the Initial Project
#### Additional Data for Games

The first is several useful fields for each game. They're simple enough I may add them from the start. The fields are:
* Estimated Playing Time (in minutes)
* Minimum Number of Players
* Maximum Number of Players
* Two URL's. They can be anything related to the game, but the suggestions are the game's page at BGG, and the manufacturer's listing for the game.

##### Using the Additional Games Data
With those data points, it becomes possible to limit games based on available time and players. Five players would rule out *Through the Ages*, which can only handle four players. Eight hours would rule out *Campaign for North Africa*, estimated at one thousand hours of playing time. (I'm not kidding. [It's a real game.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/campaign-north-africa)). 

### Maybe for the Initial Project
#### Better Voting
With a small set of players and a large number of games, ties are likely. 

#### Saved Sessions
This is not "saved sessions" in the User Authentication sense, but bin the sense of "gaming sessions."  Gaming sessions can be created with lists of players who can vote on what to play. There's a field to add a brief description, so allow for a kind of gaming diary.

### Not Likely for the Initial Project
#### True User Authentication
Users can only cast their own votes. 

### Definitely Far Off
#### The BGG API
I'd love to access the API at BGG and pull data about the games, and, beyond that, even use player account data for players in my app. Besides time considerations, The Geek's API is XML based, so I'd need to learn how to access that.
